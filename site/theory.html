        Basically a light bluish color, and every single paragraph tag was styled to be 50 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall, and we gave it a nice one pixel border.

    <p id="floatLeft">
        Also, floats don't have vertical margin collapse, so previously hidden or collapsed margins will show up once you float the element. And remember that to resume normal document flow, use the clear property. Either clear left, clear right or clear both. Next, we're going to talk about relative and absolute element positioning.
